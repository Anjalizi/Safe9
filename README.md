# The aim is to curb the problem of female foeticide and infanticide by keeping a strict vigilance on the use of sonography machine and to take care of the baby after birth.

Having been denied the opportunity to take birth well defines the extent of hardships women in India continue to face since posterity. Rather than directing technological advancements in the medical field to give people better treatments, prenatal sex determination was brought up which has destroyed and continues to destroy thousands of lives in India every year. Girl child is considered a social and economic burden to the parents in the Indian society and to escape this, families prefer to kill the child in the womb itself even before itâ€™s born. Addressing the problem of a declining sex ratio and joining hands to curb female foeticide is vital. Though strict laws and penalties are present for violators, they are far off from being implemented and there seems to be no end to this illegal practice which continues to end innocent lives every minute.
